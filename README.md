# TBC x USAID Project

## Introduction
This project is a web-based platform designed for the TBC x USAID program. It aims to provide users with information about the program, courses offered, and other related resources.

## Structure

- `assets/img`: Hosts all the images used throughout the project.
- `scripts`: Includes JavaScript files that add interactivity to the web pages.

## Methods and Techniques Used

### CSS
